### Game Description

* #### What is the main action in the game?
The main action in the game is the pushing blocks action. The player has to move the coloured blocks to their designated coloured pressure plates. The game finishes when all of the pressure plates have been triggered. The game can also end if you play for more longer than or equal to 4 minutes.

* #### What was the hardest part of the game to get working in Unreal?
The hardest part of the game is actually the pushing components and sorting those mechanics with their animations. This was the first steep learning curve that I had to do in unreal where I have to understand how the blueprint classes interact and work with each other. I had to learn how to apply logic like what you expect in code to blueprint and somehow have to also understand how animation transitions work and how to incorporate sound effects per given movement. I learned a lot from this experience and I am a step closer to understanding how these interactions work. 


* #### What is the most interesting part of the game?
There really isn't interesting about the game. It is a simple game, but learning to create a game in Unreal was very interesting to do. Everytime you learn something, that sort of logic thinking that I have when coding gets to be applied and the features of Unreal Engine becomes much easier to use. World and character building was very interesting to do. I thought retargeting your character for their skeletal mesh was complicated, but it wasn't too bad. I get to experiment with certain animations and how I can implement their sound mechanics and their interactions with other actors. The whole journey of learning Unreal was very interesting, mostly confusing and somehow rewarding.
